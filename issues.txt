301 redirect for old archive datestamps
https://downloads.imagej.net/fiji/archive/[0-9]* -> stable/
and 301 redirects for old 'latest' archive names into equivalent stable names.

301 redirect downloads.imagej.net/fiji/future/ -> downloads.imagej.net/fiji/latest/
-------------------

TO DO NEXT:
- Set all of Fiji.app to macosx (since macosx is now a platform group).
- Update jdk-latest.txt and jre-latest.txt to use macos64, not macosx, for macos-x64.
- Update generate-archives.sh to special-case the macosx platform group folder correctly.
- Then generate the fiji-latest-*.zip bundles and upload all bundles to fiji/future/.
- Then ask LOCI Fiji team to test for all platforms they can access.
- Fix identified problems, and repeat until all known problems are fixed.
- Then invite the Image.sc community to test the bundles.
^^^^ START HERE
- generating stable works now.
- we need to ship jars/macosx with macos-arm64 distro, because it contains both arches.
- we need to ship *all* of Fiji.app for *both* macosx and macos-arm64
- macosx = universal
- macos-arm64 = Apple silicon only
- macos64 = Intel only
